# home_assistant

This is my Home Assistant config folder (excluding secrets.yaml and known_devices.yaml as expected).

My configuration file has been split up to allow me to edit a specific module with out my previous issues those being.

    Scroll Scroll SCroll Scroll. all the time. Splitiing the modules made it easier to find what i need faster.
    backup and restore easier than one big confiuration.yaml
    restore specified module if system hangs after modifying.
    
All sensitive data has been referenced to a secrets.yaml file with all required sensitive data in one place. (NOT INCLUDED CREATE YOUR OWN)

Hoping this helps improve your home assistant experience as much as it did mine.
